<h1>Ffmedia Folders</h1>

<p>This page shows the list of folders in use for storing either Images or Files. Use the
Select Media Type drop-down list to switch. The list is displayed on the left of the screen,
or near the top on narrow screens.</p>

<p>Select a Folder Tree item to perform one of the following actions:</p>

<h2>Actions</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Index Selected Folder</dt>
<dd>
This action processes the files in the selected folder and inserts or updates
a record in the database. 
</dd>

<dt>Index All Folders</dt>

<dd>
This action processes all of the files in all of the folders and inserts or updates
a record in the database. It may take quite a long time, perhaps several seconds for
1000 images. If some folders contain a lot of files it may appear to have stopped. 
Please be patient - there is no completion notice.
</dd>

<dt>Index Selected Folder</dt>
<dd>
This action processes all of the files in the selected folder and inserts or updates
a record in the database. Use this option if indexing all folders runs into time-out 
trouble.
</dd>

<dt>Hash All Folders</dt>
<dd>
This action processes all of the files in the selected folder and updates the file hash
field in the database record. It may take quite a long time. Perhaps several seconds for
1000 images. The hash field is not currently used but may be used in the future to 
identify identical files.
</dd>

<dt>Hash Selected Folder</dt>
<dd>
This action processes all of the files in the selected folder and updates the file hash
field in the database record. Use this option if hashing all folders runs into time-out 
trouble.
</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Folders</h2>

<dl>
<dt>New Folder</dt>
<dd>
This action prompts for a new folder name and creates the folder. All characters except 
alphanumeric and minus (-) are replace by <strong>-</strong> (minus). You will be asked 
to confirm that the file name is acceptable. Please use minus characters
to separate words.
</dd>

<dt>Delete if Empty</dt>
<dd>
This action deletes a folder only if it is empty.
</dd>

</dl>

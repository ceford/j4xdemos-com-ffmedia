<h1>Ffmedia Images</h1>

<h2>Folder Tree</h2>

<p>The Folder Tree shows the first level of the folder tree with deeper levels for a 
selecteded branch of the tree. The selected folder is shown as an open folder icon.</p>

<h2>Images List</h2>

<p>No images are catalogued at installation. To get started, select the 
<strong>Folders</strong> menu item and then select <strong>Index All Folders</strong> 
from the <strong>Actions</strong> drop-down list in the Toolbar. Then come back here.</p>

<p>The list shows all of the images in the selected folder and all of its subfolders.
Images can be filtered by any one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Search.</strong> Enter any text that may be in the file name, the alt 
description or the caption.</li>

<li><strong>Status.</strong> May be Published (default), Trashed or Deleted.</li>

<li><strong>Depth.</strong> May be Tree (default), meaning the selected folder and all
its descendants, or Folder, meaning just the selected folder.</li>

<li><strong>Extension.</strong> The list shows the extensions enabled in the Options 
configuration.</li>

</ul>

<p>The thumbnail image is a link to a modal dialog which displays the image full-size or
the width of the dialog, whichever is smaller.</p>

<p>The <strong>Actions</strong> list for each image allows selection of various types
of tag to paste into a document, or to Trash, Restore or Delete an image, depending on 
the Status selection.</p>

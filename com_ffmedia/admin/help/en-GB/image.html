<h2>Photograph Sizes</h2>

<p>It is best to prepare photographs for import - crop and resize for use on the web. 
Original photographs can be enormous and will take a long time to upload. Photographs 
larger than the limits set for this component or the hosting service will be rejected 
after upload. Photographs should be in jpg formt. Line art should be in png format.</p>

existing image you can change the metadata without changing the file. Or you can change 
the file without changing the metadata. Or you can change both at the same time.</p>

		keyword searching.
